## ðŸ¦„ Yinxi Li | Currently Masterâ€™s Student in Computer Science
Hey there, I'm Larry! Thanks for visiting my page. I'm currently a CS MMath candidate at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), advised by Prof. [Pengyu Nie](https://pengyunie.github.io). Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), and my final year project was advised by Prof. [Eric Lo](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo/). I also spent a semester as an exchange student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I explored advanced topics in Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

## ðŸ’» Research & Technical Interests
- NLP - still exploring my master's thesis topic
- LLMs for Software Engineering - improving code generation, code understanding using LLM techniques
- Broad Interest in LLM Advancements - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Mixture of Experts (MoE), efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA), Chain of Thought (CoT), alignment techniques (such as RLHF)
