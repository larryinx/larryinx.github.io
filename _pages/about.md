#### ðŸ¦„ About Me | Currently Masterâ€™s Student in CS
Hey there, I'm Larry! Thanks for visiting my humble page. I'm currently a CS M.Math. candidate at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), advised by Prof. [Pengyu Nie](https://pengyunie.github.io). Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science (ELITE Stream) from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), and my final year project was advised by Prof. [Eric Lo](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ericlo). I also spent a semester as an exchange student at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) during my undergraduate, where I explored advanced topics in Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

#### ðŸ’» Research & Technical Interests
- NLP - still exploring my master's thesis topic
- LLMs for Software Engineering - improving code generation, code understanding using LLM techniques
- Broad Interest in LLM Advancements - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Mixture of Experts (MoE), efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA), Chain of Thought (CoT), alignment techniques (such as RLHF)

**ðŸ¥‚ Always Open for a Chat!**
I'm always happy to discuss anything, whether it's research-related or just a casual conversation. **Feel free to reach out to me**, as long as you come in with a friendly attitude and no ill intentions ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ.
